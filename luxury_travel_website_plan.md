# Luxury Travel Website - Project Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for building the initial version of the luxury travel website. The focus is on delivering a **React.js-based, multi-page site** with **read-only mock data** and **interactive UI elements (clicks & drag/drop only)**.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js
- **UI Library**: MUI
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Data Management**: JSON files with Local State
- **Image Handling**: Free API (e.g., Unsplash)
- **Deployment**: Local Deployment (No CI/CD in Phase 1)
- **User Interactions**: Clicks and drag/drop only (No input forms)

## Page Structure
1. **Homepage**
   - Hero section with stunning luxury travel imagery
   - Introduction to curated itineraries
   - Featured destinations with quick links

2. **Destination Overview Page** (e.g., `/destinations/paris`)
   - High-quality images & brief description
   - Top luxury experiences in the location
   - Suggested high-end accommodations

3. **Pre-Designed Itineraries Page** (e.g., `/itineraries`)
   - List of pre-made luxury itineraries
   - Click to view full details

4. **Itinerary Detail Page** (e.g., `/itineraries/french-riviera-5-days`)
   - Day-by-day breakdown (activities, accommodations, dining)
   - Read-only experience (customization comes later)

5. **About & Contact Page**
   - Explanation of the luxury travel approach
   - Contact form deferred to a later phase

## Features (Phase 1)
âœ… Destination selection  
âœ… Pre-designed itineraries  
âœ… Activity & hotel selection  
âœ… Simple itinerary review (read-only)  
âœ… Clickable & drag/drop interactions  
ðŸš« No user input forms (Phase 1)  
ðŸš« No booking functionality yet  
ðŸš« No backend or database in this phase  

## Data Handling
- All mock data will be stored in static **JSON files**.
- Local state will manage temporary selections.
- No persistent storage in Phase 1.

## Development Workflow
1. **Set up project**: Initialize Vite, install dependencies (React, MUI, React Router)
2. **Define routing**: Implement multi-page navigation with React Router
3. **Create JSON mock data**: Define static data for destinations, itineraries, and experiences
4. **Build UI components**: Implement MUI-based UI with a luxury aesthetic
5. **Integrate Unsplash API**: Fetch high-quality images dynamically
6. **Implement interactions**: Enable clickable and drag/drop actions
7. **Test locally**: Ensure smooth navigation and data rendering
8. **Deploy locally**: No CI/CD yet, focus on local development

## Future Considerations (Beyond Phase 1)
- **User customization**: Allow itinerary modifications
- **AI-powered recommendations**: Smart suggestions based on preferences
- **Booking system**: Integrate with luxury hotels & experience providers
- **User accounts & saved itineraries**: Enable persistent trip planning

## Timeline (Phase 1)
| Task | Duration |
|------|----------|
| Project Setup & Dependencies | 1 day |
| Routing & Navigation | 2 days |
| JSON Data Creation | 1 day |
| UI Components & Styling | 3 days |
| Unsplash API Integration | 1 day |
| Click & Drag/Drop Interactions | 2 days |
| Testing & Refinements | 2 days |
| **Total Estimated Time** | **~12 days** |
